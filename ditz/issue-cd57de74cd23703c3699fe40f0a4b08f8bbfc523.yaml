title: --verbose / -v option does not work
desc: |-
  original: http://code.google.com/p/hardlinkpy/issues/detail?id=7
  
  What steps will reproduce the problem?
  1. use one of the following options:
     -v 0
     --verbose=0
  
  What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
  There should be less output and for verbosity 2 more output. There's more
  output instead.
  
  What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?
  Revision 20 on Ubuntu Hardy 8.04 with Python 2.5.2.
  
  Please provide any additional information below.
  The "verbose" option is interpreted as a string, and comparisons to
  integers on lines 132, 204 and 264 are always true when any value for the
  option has been specified on the command line.
