title: If run for current directory, files in the root not linked
desc: |-
  Suppose we have this tree and all files have identical content:
  
    mydir/
      file1
      file2
      subdir1/
        file3
        file4
      subdir2/
        file5
        file6
  
  Now run these commands:
  
    cd mydir
    hardlink.py .
  
  As a result, files 3-6 are hardlinked, but files 1-2 are not.

  If we re-create the tree, do *not* change the working directory to
  mydir and run "hardlink.py mydir", all files are linked. The same is
  true if the current working directory is mydir/subdir1 or
  mydir/subdir2 and "hardlink.py .." is run.
